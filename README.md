How to proceed using these scripts

1. The loading file loads and clean all datafiles
2. The preplotting file further cleanes the time series and prepare for plotting and analysing the data
3. The correlations_* files focus on individual aspects of the landslides to correlate them, especially through the ARDL model
4. The figures file creates most of the figures for the paper
